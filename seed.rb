      <p>British Columbia, a Canadian province, will finally start charging companies like Nestlé for taking its groundwater and bottling it to sell at a profit. <strong>The problem is it will only be charging $2.25 per million litres.</strong></p>
      <p>Under this new pricing structure<strong> Nestlé and corporations like it will be able to buy up Canada\'s water for next to nothing.</strong> When over one hundred thousand people objected to Nestlé taking 285 million litres of Canada\'s water for free and selling it around the world, <strong>this wasn\'t the fix they had in mind. </strong></p>
      <p>At a time when water is in short supply globally, it is outrageous that <strong>Nestlé can draw limitless amounts of Canada\'s natural resources to sell for a huge profit. </strong>Nestlé\'s chairman says that \"extremist\" NGOs are responsible for the idea that water is a human right, and that water should have a market price -- apparently he thinks that the “market price\" for him is $2.25.</p>
      <p>Tell the government of British Columbia to charge a fair price for Canada\'s most precious resource.</p>
      <p>The cruel irony is that the new water legislation is fairly appropriate when it comes to individuals\' water use -- <strong>but corporations, once again, get off with paying virtually nothing. </strong>If a Canadian were to bottle enough groundwater to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool,<strong> they\'d pay $180. Nestlé will pay $6.25. </strong>That\'s bananas.</p>
      <p>Canada has some of the purest, cleanest and most delicious water in the world -- and Nestlé doesn\'t think anything of sucking it out of the ground for a pittance and selling it back in a plastic bottle. Nor does the government, apparently. This new pricing structure, which was supposed to fix the problem of freeloading corporations,<strong> is even more outrageous at a time when many parts of the world are facing extreme water shortages</strong>.</p>
      <p>We need your voice to stop this. <strong>SumOfUs members across the globe have mobilized in the hundreds of thousands to call for Nestle to stop exploiting water rights</strong>. From Pakistan to Canada, we are going to make sure Nestle can\'t walk away with our water without paying a fair price.</p>
      <p>Call on the government of British Columbia to stop allowing Nestlé and other corporate freeloaders from extracting Canada\'s water for next to nothing.</p>

      <p>U.S. lawmakers are about to introduce a <strong>shady piece of legislation called Fast Track to help ram through a massive trade pact designed in secret with multinational corporations.</strong></p>
      <p>\"Fast Track\" would give Congress the ability to hammer the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal through -- even though experts warn the deal will <strong>hurt jobs, food safety standards, access to life-saving medicine and democracy.</strong></p>
      <p>Fast Track could be introduced any day now, but inside sources say the numbers are really tight, and <strong>politicians aren\'t sure they have the votes to pass this controversial bill</strong>. A reminder from us right now -- the people that elected our members of Congress -- could be what stops Fast Track for good. But we need to act fast to make sure our leaders stand up for us and not corporations.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sign the petition to Congress to say no to Fast Track and no TPP!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Fast Track is also known as Trade Promotion Authority. It creates special rules that empower the White House to negotiate and sign trade agreements without Congressional oversight. Lawmakers won\'t be able to analyze and change them -- and have only <strong>90 days to make a Yes or No vote to ratify the entire treaty.</strong></p>
      <p>The TPP deal would hand corporations the right to <strong>sue the government for billions in secret courts</strong> when it tries to pass laws that protect our children, the environment or the economy. And worse, taxpayers would foot the bill. </p>
      <p>The final ministerial round of the TPP talks was just delayed, and an <strong>emergency round of negotiations</strong> <strong>is scheduled</strong> to start in two weeks in Hawaii. Sources say the reason for the delay and change in plan is to make sure Fast Track passes -- and fast. What this means is that the very balance of the TPP deal depends on Fast Track passing -- and that\'s why we need to stop it now. </p>
      <p><strong>Congress is still deeply divided on Fast Track</strong> -- and calls from the people that elected them could make sure they stand up for us and not the corporate lobby.</p>
      <p>People power has stopped Fast Track before. Last year, when SumOfUs members and allies <strong>signed petitions and piled on thousands of calls,</strong> we stopped Fast Track in its tracks. Right now, we need to do it again. </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can you sign the petition to Congress now to say no to Fast Track and the TPP?</strong>

      <p>The <strong>Alberta government is about to release new rules that decide how much water tar sands companies can take </strong>from the Athabasca River to extract water-intensive bitumen.</p>
      <p>The law reads like an <strong>industry wish list</strong> -- giving generous exemptions to tar sands companies to take as much water from the Athabasca River whenever they want it -- even when animals, plant life and the ecosystem are in danger.</p>
      <p>This is reckless. <strong>These new rules are an environmental disaster waiting to happen</strong> -- especially after the Alberta government promised \"world-leading environmental protection\". A massive public outcry could force the government to go back to the negotiating table and stop giving handouts to tar sands companies.</p>
      <p><strong>Sign the petition to the Alberta government: go back to the negotiating table and release water rules that protect the Athabasca -- not corporate profits.</strong></p>
      <p>The Alberta government claims it consulted First Nations and scientists when drafting these new rules -- but these new rules are not only dangerous; they\'re the very proposals put forward by companies like Suncor and Syncrude. <strong>This is corporate takeover of our democracy.</strong></p>
      <p>Tar sands bitumen is the most water-intensive oil on the planet -- it takes<strong> three times more fresh water to produce bitumen than conventional oil.</strong> These laws literally impact the survival of a river system and countless species of animals and plant life. We can\'t allow this government-industry collusion to stand.</p>
      <p>The Alberta government has been told by First Nations, scientists and experts repeatedly of the need for a critical cut off level to protect one of the most important watersheds in the world. And now, their callousness is putting<strong> the Athabasca River in real danger.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Sign the petition to the Alberta government: stop being in the industry\'s back pocket and release water laws that protect the Athabasca River.</strong></p>
      <p>This isn\'t just about water. This is a bigger issue of <strong>corporate capture of our governments, and of corporate power run amok.</strong> Industry shouldn\'t get handouts -- especially when there\'s so much at stake.</p>
      <p>Our community has been hard at work making sure government and industry are accountable to people over profits -- and together, <strong>we\'ve helped protect wolves, whales and our natural parks from industry</strong><strong>.</strong> Last year, we collectively fought the Alberta government when it tried to let tar sands companies write children\'s school curriculum. Now, let\'s make sure it doesn\'t give Big Oil free reign over the Athabasca River.</p>

      <p><strong>Tell the Abbott government to disclose the list of big banks that it\'s been lobbying. </strong></p>
      <p>The government is hell-bent on <strong>expanding the already huge coal port at Abbot Point,</strong> which is smack bang in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef. <strong>One bank after another has balked at financing the project</strong> -- these banks are starting to realise that this is an unprofitable venture that could damage their international reputations. No bank wants to be known as the one destroying a stunning, natural wonder of the world. </p>
      <p><strong>But now, the gains we\'ve made could be under threat. </strong>Nick Minchin, our consul general in New York and former Minister in the Howard Government, has made stealthy visits to big banks\' headquarters to \"discuss\" the coal terminal. </p>
      <p><strong>We can stop this. </strong></p>
      <p>It starts with finding out just which banks the government is lobbying. Then, we can amp up the pressure on these banks to make sure they don\'t cave to Tony Abbott. But we need to act quickly if we\'re to stop the banks from changing their minds. SumOfUs members have already come together to stop major international banks like Citibank from sacrificing our Reef. And this time, we\'ll do it again. </p>
      <p><strong>Join us -- demand that the Abbott government release the list of banks it has been lobbying. </strong></p>
      <p>Let\'s stop this corporate destruction of our Great Barrier Reef. </p>
